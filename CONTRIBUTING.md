Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! This file is written for first-time open-source contributors and repository owners who want to encourage collaboration.

1) Quick start — how to contribute
----------------------------------
- Fork the repository on GitHub.
- Create a feature branch in your fork:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-improvement
```

- Make small, focused changes and commit with clear messages.
- Push your branch to your fork and open a Pull Request (PR) against `main` in this repo.

2) PR checklist for contributors
-------------------------------
- Describe the purpose of the change in the PR description.
- Include a short list of what you changed and why.
- Add tests where appropriate or demonstrate the change with an example.
- Ensure linting and formatting (the project uses standard Python formatting; run `ruff` or `black` if configured).
- Keep the scope small: one feature or fix per PR.

3) Branching & commit guidance
------------------------------
- Use feature branches named with the pattern: `feature/<short-desc>`, `fix/<short-desc>`, or `docs/<short-desc>`.
- Write commit messages that are imperative and short, e.g. "Add README contributing section".

4) Code style and tests
-----------------------
- Keep code readable and idiomatic Python.
- If the change affects behavior, add a small test or example demonstrating the behavior.

5) How maintainers will review
------------------------------
- We'll review PRs and give constructive feedback. Expect maintainers to ask for small iterations (style, tests, or clarifications).
- If you're new to open source, ask small clarifying questions in the PR thread — maintainers will help.

6) Reporting issues
-------------------
- Please open issues for bugs or feature requests with a clear title, steps to reproduce, and expected vs actual behavior.

7) Code of conduct
------------------
- Be respectful and constructive. The mission is for us to help each other.

8) Contact & communication
--------------------------
- For quick questions, open an issue and tag it with `question` or `help-wanted`.
- For larger contributions, consider opening a discussion issue first to get alignment.

Thank you for helping! Every contribution helps improve the project and is appreciated.
